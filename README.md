## Description

See http://www.stixfonts.org/ for a description of the the STIX Fonts
project.

Download the [current version](zipfiles/STIXv2.0.0.zip) of the OTF,
WOFF, and WOFF2 files in a zip archive.

The STIX Two fonts are a set of OpenType fonts and are meant to be
used in that format.  For the benefit of LaTeX users who are unable to
use XeTeX or luaTeX, we have also provided version 2.0.0 of the STIX
fonts as a [set of TFM files and Type 1 fonts](Type1).  These are also
available as a separate [zip file](zipfiles/STIXv2.0.0-type1.zip).
